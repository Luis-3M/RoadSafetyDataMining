# RoadSafetyDataMining

The Department for Transport of the UK Government has been collecting detailed road safety data about the circumstances of the traffic road accidents on public roads in Great Britain, involving personal injuries and reported to the police.
The aim of this practical assignment was to use frequent pattern mining and association rules to study patterns on the circumstances of registered road traffic accidents in Great Britain during the year of 2015.

We used R Studio to perform Data Mining tasks and also a nice and clean R Markdown report.
